# drag_ui_element


1-Press and drag


2-Drop the draggable


3-Add a menu item to a cart


4-Interactive example


Drag and drop is a common mobile app interaction. As the user long presses (sometimes called touch & hold) on a widget, another widget appears beneath the user’s finger, and the user drags the widget to a final location and releases it. In this recipe, you’ll build a drag-and-drop interaction where the user long presses on a choice of food, and then drags that food to the picture of the customer who is paying for it.
